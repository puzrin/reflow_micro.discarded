**WIP**

> Simple to build & compact table for hobby projects reflow assembly.

This tool helps to build modern and complicated electronic devices at home.
It's very small, and ideally suits for hobbyists, who assemble PCBs from time to
time an don't wish to keep big reflowers from microwave ovens.

Working area is up to 70\*60mm. That's enougth for almost all hobby PCBs with
SMD components.

Until WIP, it tracks progress and has useful tips in build logs.

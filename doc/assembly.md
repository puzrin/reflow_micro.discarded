## Required components

### General

&nbsp; | Name | Comment
-------|------|--------
1 | [PCB & Components](https://easyeda.com/reflow/reflow-micro-table) | Go to EasyEda project page and order both in couple of clicks. If you order PCB first, components second - you will be able to join delivery. Add rocker switch below to LCSC order.
2 | [2.4" Display](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32852776943.html) | 240*320, SPI, ILI9341, touch screen.
3 | [Cooling fan 5010](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000194163972.html) |
4 | [22 AWG wire](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32854919883.html) | Optional, SMT stencil positioning.
5 | [DIN965 M1.6 SS screws 20mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33013472653.html) | Mount heater plate to PCB. Should be stainless steel, important!
6 | [DIN965 M1.6 black screws 8mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000217127933.html) | MCH mount
7 | [M1.6 SS washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000222547150.html) | MCH mount
8 | [M1.6 SS spring lock washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000222556028.html) | MCH mount
9 | [M2 inserts 3mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000513304304.html) | Case components mount places.
10 | [M2 flat cap screws 14mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000217127933.html) | Case assembly, cooling fan mount.
11 | [M2 Spring lock washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32982630546.html) | Hinges assembly.
12 | [M2 washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32859516826.html) | Hinges assembly.
13 | [M2 nuts](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32859946901.html) | Hinges assembly, cooling fan mount.
14 | [M2 flat cap screws 8mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000217127933.html) | Hinges assembly.
15 | [Mushroom head M2 screws 5mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000168030333.html) | PCB mount.
16 | [MCH 50\*50\*2mm 150W](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33005272347.html) | [Alternate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32991559341.html). Minimal power at room temp - 130W. For 110 volts buy 300W one.
17 | [Aluminium plate 4mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32998175339.html) | [Alternate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32985318306.html).  Heater. You may also wish to buy 2mm plate for shims, if have no circular saw.
18 | Aluminum Foil 50Î¼m (0.05mm) | Heater bottom insulation. Such foil is sold for sauna insulation. You can also try foil from baking forms.
19 | [Aluminium sticky tape](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33036337241.html) | PCB reflector. You need fat, 50-100um tape, 30-50mm wide. Don't use cheap thin one, it will not work as needed.
20 | Temperature resistant black paint | Coating for heater top.
21 | [Thermal conductive paste](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32870824982.html) | Should work at 300C. Don't try cheap ones.

Note. You are strongly advised to order SMT stencil for your PCB. That will
add ~ 8$ in total to your order - good price for convenience. On placing stencil
order at jlcpcb, select option "custom size", and set 160\*. Then stencil
will be compact and light, with small delivery cost.

**Important!** If you order SMT stencil, add text note to your order: "**make
stencil according to paste mask file and don't forget corner holes**".


### Optional

See [heater assembly](heater_assembly.md) docs for details. May be you already
have drill stand and so on.

1 | [Drill bit 1.7mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33023895090.html) | 2 pcs at least, HSS Co (M35) preferable.
2 | [Drill bit 3.1mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33023951160.html) | HSS Co (M35) preferable.
3 | [Miter track](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32972951062.html) | Drilling conductor
4 | [M6 20mm philips screws](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32854305389.html) | Drilling conductor
5 | [Aluminum heating plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000073462890.html) | Paint baking.
6 | [Dimmer](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32818012686.html) | Regulate heating plate above.
7 | [Mini table saw](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32845187139.html) | Cut aluminum plates.
8 | Sanding paper | 60, 120, 240, 400 grit

If you are patient enough, you can cut aluminum with hand saw. But circular
saw is much more convenient.


## Heater assembly

All details are  in [separate document](heater_assembly.md) to keep this one
compact.

That's the most boring part. Read is carefully before start making this device.


## PCB assembly

Pin SMT stencil and PCB with 22 AWG wire to silicon pad.

<img src="images/pcb_smt_stencil.jpg" width="60%" alt="PCB with SMT stencil">

Apply soldering paste, place SMD components and solder all with air gun.
Inspect result and fix defects with soldering iron if needed.

<img src="images/pcb_bottom.jpg" width="60%" alt="PCB bottom">

Cleanup PCB from flux and place sticky aluminum type on area behind heater.
Also place any insulating type on small area behind display.

<img src="images/pcb_top.jpg" width="60%" alt="PCB top">

Mount display & heater.

<img src="images/pcb_all.jpg" width="60%" alt="All mounted">

Now everything ready to be flashed and placed into case.

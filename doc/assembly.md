## Required components

### General

&nbsp; | Name | Comment
-------|------|--------
1 | [PCB & Components](https://easyeda.com/reflow/reflow-micro-table) | Go to EasyEda project page and order both in couple of clicks. If you order PCB first, components second, then you will be able to join delivery and save some bucks.
2 | [2.4" Display](https://aliexpress.ru/item/32852776943.html) | 240*320, SPI, ILI9341, touch screen.
3 | [Power cord](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32961795481.html) |
4 | [Rocker switch](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Rocker-Switches_HONGJU-MR6-210-C5L-BR_C268234.html) |
5 | [22 AWG wire](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32854919883.html) | Optional, SMT stencil positioning.
6 | [M1.6 SS screws 20mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33013472653.html) | Mount heater plate to PCB.
7 | [M1.6 8mm black screws](https://aliexpress.ru/item/4000217127933.html) | MCH mount
8 | [M1.6 SS washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000222547150.html) |
9 | [M1.6 SS spring lock washers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000222556028.html) |
10 | [MCH heater 50*50mm 150W](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33005272347.html) | Alt: [1](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32991559341.html). Minimal power at room temp - 130W. For 110 volts buy 300W one.
11 | [Aluminium plate 4mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32998175339.html) | Alt: [1](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32985318306.html).  Heater. You may also wish to buy 2mm plate for shims, if have no circular saw.
12 | Aluminum Foil 50μm (0.05mm) | Heater bottom insulation. Such foil is sold for sauna insulation. You can also try foil from baking forms.
13 | [Aluminium sticky tape](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33036337241.html) | PCB reflector. You need fat, 50-100um tape, 30-50mm wide. Don't use cheap thin one, it will not work as needed.
14 | Temperature resistant black paint | Coating for heater top.
15 | [Thermal conductive paste](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32870824982.html) | Should work at 300C. Don't try cheap ones.

Note. You are strongly advised to order SMT stencil for your PCB. That will
add ~ 8$ in total to your order - good price for convenience. On placing stencil
order at jlcpcb, select option "custom size", and define small one. Then stencil
will be compact and light, with small delivery cost.


### Optional

See [heater assembly](heater_assembly.md) docs for details. May be you already
have drill stand and so on.

8 | Sanding paper | 60, 120, 240, 400 grit

If you are patient enough, you can cut aluminum with hand saw. But circular
saw is much more convenient.
